description: |
  A three-phase prompting system (Map, Mine, Move) designed to quickly gain functional expertise, identify hidden risks, and create actionable plans for complex projects or unfamiliar domains. Use this when you need to handle situations outside your core expertise like hiring, legal issues, or evaluating new technology. Use when user says: "map mine move", "apply the mmm framework", "I'm entering a domain I know nothing about", "help me avoid blind spots in this project".

# Ai Prompting For Unfamiliar Domains

## Core Rules

- Always maintain the same conversation thread to benefit from compounding context across all three phases.
- Utilize the highest-end reasoning model available to ensure deep insight and logical consistency.
- Use dictation when providing context to capture rich, unedited detail without self-censorship.
- Request simplified executive briefings (e.g., 5th-grade level) to grasp core concepts quickly without jargon.
- Apply the inversion principle by focusing on how a project could fail rather than just how it could succeed.
- Prioritize second-order effects over immediate, obvious results to understand long-term implications.
- Solicit 'veteran advice'—the kind of insights a 20-year expert would share over coffee that aren't found in manuals.
- End every session with a concrete 'cheat sheet' or action plan containing specific questions and first steps.

## When to Apply

- When faced with a project or challenge completely outside your past experience.
- When you need to get up to speed on a new domain's vocabulary and landscape in minutes.
- When preparing for a high-stakes conversation where you are 'smart but not an expert'.
- When you want to identify blind spots and expensive mistakes before they happen.

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't start new chat threads between the Map, Mine, and Move phases; you lose the cumulative context.
- Avoid asking basic, generic questions that result in average, surface-level AI answers.
- Don't focus exclusively on the path to success; ignoring potential failures leads to hidden traps.
- Don't rely on low-tier or faster models for these tasks; they often miss the subtle complexities and second-order effects.

## Workflow

1. Map: Define your role and situation, then request an executive briefing on key terms, major approaches, and common outsider misunderstandings.
2. Mine: Use dictation to provide deep context and ask the AI to uncover hidden complexities, expensive mistakes, and veteran-level insights.
3. Analyze: Specifically request second-order effects and tricky elements that seem simple but are actually difficult.
4. Move: Dictate your final readiness needs and request 3-5 critical questions to ask, information to gather, and the smartest first step.
5. Action: Consolidate all derived insights into a tactical cheat sheet for immediate use.

## Examples

- A business owner learning about marketing agency pricing structures (retainers vs. performance-based) before hiring.
- Identifying 'bait and switch' risks where senior executives pitch a project but juniors actually execute the work.
- Discovering that a new ad account requires 3-4 months of testing before meaningful results are possible.
